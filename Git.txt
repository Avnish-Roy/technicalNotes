Git

--one of the most popular version control systems is a Git, a distributed VCS.
  Git is a mature , actively maintained , open source project compatible with many operating systems
   and IDEs.
  Git is different from other version control systems by its way of recording changes.Others 
   systems add changes to a database, where Git records changes as a stream of snapshots.

Git has another advantages--
 it is distributed , rather than having only one single place for the full version histroy of a project, 
  developer's working copy of the code is also a repository that can contain the full history of all changes.


History::
