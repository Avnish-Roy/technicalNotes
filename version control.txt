what is version control...

When you are wroking on a simple project , such as a single page html, it is fairly easy to remember the last thing you changed 
and where the development is headed. but tracking revisions over time, also referred to as version control, quickly 
becomes more complex when you are working on a large project with multiple files and multiple developers.

you not only want to record  changes, but also who made the changes, and when. managing revisions at this level requires
a version  control system.

Version Control System help a software team manage changes to source code over time.
VCS software includes tools for saving the state of a project, viewing the history of changes, and reverting changes.

Developing software without using version control is risky.
similar to not have backups.

VCS can also enhance and speed u development . depending on the version control software used, many developers can work
on the same code at the same time...



for example:: one developer on the team may be working on a new feature while another developer fixes and unrelated
bug, each developer making their changes in several parts of the code base.

VCS even have tools to prevent conflicts when one developer's changes are incompatible with changes made at the same time
by another developer...

One of the most popular version control Systems is Git....
